Application to process input query, and display the knowledge graph

1. [bm25.py](https://github.com/DroidRonin/kg-flask-app/blob/main/BM25-Retreival/bm25.py) in [BM25-Retreival directory](https://github.com/DroidRonin/kg-flask-app/blob/main/BM25-Retreival/) is for retrieving relevant documents based on given terms; [preprocess.py](https://github.com/DroidRonin/kg-flask-app/blob/main/BM25-Retreival/preprocess.py) creates tokenised tokens of the original dataset to be used for BM-25 search. 
2. [flask.py](https://github.com/DroidRonin/kg-flask-app/blob/main/flask.py) processes the user query and projects a knowledge graph using [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/) library.
3. [get_triples.py](https://github.com/DroidRonin/kg-flask-app/blob/main/get_triples.py) returns the processed triples from input query. It uses the berkley neural parser to consider the whole noun-phrase and verb-phrase instead of the bottom-most node of the tree (overcoming the limitation offered by the package [nlptriples](https://pypi.org/project/nlptriples/)).  It applies a brute-force method to get all the triples (good and bad) from the input text, also solving the inadequacy of triples problem by [nlptriples](https://pypi.org/project/nlptriples/). 
4. [CosineSimilarity.py](https://github.com/DroidRonin/kg-flask-app/blob/main/CosineSimilarity.py) finds the most relevant triples using an embeddings model (word2vec trained, not included here) and returns a dataframe of final triples 
5. [preprocess.py](https://github.com/DroidRonin/kg-flask-app/blob/main/preprocess.py) removes special characters and lowercases the data. It does not tokenise it, since that is handled by the get_triples.py file.
